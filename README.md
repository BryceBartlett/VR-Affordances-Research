# VR-Affordances-Research

  Working with the University of Utah's Psychology Department this project was developed to test the effects of VR on a person's perception.
The experiment begins with a menu where test subject information is collected and the starting test is chosen. Once the the test begins the
subject will enter a tutorial where the research assistant administering the test will explain that cubes will appear at various distances
and the subject should answer yes or no as to whether or not they believe they could grasp the cube with a single hand. Cubes will appear
in the center of the table as the subject answers yes or no.

 Cubes will appear at various distances depending on the test, of wich there are two. The first will place one of 14 cubes randomly at
 distances of 40cm away from the edge of the table or 60cm. Each cube will apear twice at each distances and once all cubes have appeared
 the test will end and if the second test has not been completed its tutorial will start.
 
 The second test spawns an 8cm cube at various distances between 10cm from the edge of the table to 90cm from the edge. The distances are
 chosen randomly and the 8cm cube swaps between appearing red and green. Once all cubes have appeared and all tests are completed the cubes
 will be removed and then the research assistant presses R on the keyboard to write all the information to a .csv file.
